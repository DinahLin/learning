The Go language provides an automated function call called **init()** just as the older versions of libc used to provide _init call.

In the Go, the import definitions of the particular libraries match with their corresponding class names with in a call.

For ex:

import "os"

os.Argv is used to get the arguments that are passed to the program at runtime. Here "os" is used which is an imported library
or the package.
